# OricCharacterBuilder
A small utility to create data for custom bitmaps for the Oric range of computers

This is just a scratchpad that a developer can use to quickly create data for custom bitmaps. I got bored with using pen and paper to create bitmap data, which is why I created this small utilitity.

The data for the currently selected char is displayed at the bottom of the screen.

Instructions for use are displayed on screen.
